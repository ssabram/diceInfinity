                    <p>Born from basement role-playing sessions around a poker table, a lifelong love of role-playing games evolved into decades of tech innovation.

When my kids discovered tabletop RPGs and challenged, ‚ÄúDad, can you write a better dice app?‚Äù, the answer was an enthusiastic yes.</p>
                    <p>Two years of funded development, seasoned by experience in mobile, UX, and device design, led to Dice Infinity‚Äîan elegant, fast, clutter-free digital dice companion. Built in Silicon Valley with a gamer‚Äôs heart and an engineer‚Äôs discipline, it‚Äôs designed to sit quietly beside your game, ready whenever physical dice aren‚Äôt. Free download‚Äîenjoy!</p>

<h3>üé≤ Gameplay</h3>

  <p><strong>What types of dice can I roll with this app?</strong><br>
  You can roll from d2 (coin flip) to a d5000.</p>

  <p><strong>How many dice can I roll?</strong><br>
  The app supports from one to a hundred dice per dice set.</p>

  <p><strong>Can I roll different types of dice at once?</strong><br>
  Yes, you can roll up to four different types of dice at once. Simple compound dice sets of "1d8 + 1d4 + 1" are supported. Extreme dice sets such as "1d5000 + 25d100 + 3d4 + 2d2" are possible.</p>

  <p><strong>I play games where you roll dice, keep some, and re-roll the rest.  Is this supported?</strong><br>
  This style of play is supported. You can individually choose which rolled dice to keep and then re-roll only the unkept dice for each round. Tap on the rolled dice and select "Keep" to omit that rolled dice from the next set roll.</p>

  <p><strong>Is this app suitable for tabletop RPG games?</strong><br>
  Yes, it's designed to work with many games that use dice.</p>

  <p><strong>What about common board games and casual dice games?</strong><br>
  You can use this app to roll dice for board games and casual dice games. You may need to use the dice set editor to customize a dice set for the game played.</p><br>

  <h3>üéØ Roll Display</h3>

  <p><strong>How can I view the results of my dice rolls‚Äîeither as a total or by counting individual die faces?</strong><br>
  The app lets you customize how roll results are shown:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dice Total:</strong> Shows the sum of all dice rolled. Ideal for RPGs or games needing cumulative values.</li>
        <li><strong>Face Count:</strong> Displays how many times each face value appears (e.g., "3 sixes, 2 ones").</li>
      </ul>
      You can switch between these display modes by:
      <ul>
        <li>Opening the <strong>‚ÄúHamburger‚Äù menu</strong> in the roll view</li>
        <li>Selecting the <strong>‚ÄúDice Total‚Äù</strong> or <strong>"Face Count"</strong></li>
      </ul>
      Choose the mode that best fits your gameplay style!</p>
      
  <p><strong>Are there any details kept about dice sets once entered and rolled?</strong><br>
  Yes, tap on the dice set and selected the "Info" menu option.  The dice count, roll average and last roll time is displayed.</p>
      
  <p><strong>Can I use dice in this app as a score keeper or a manual counter?</strong><br>
  Yes, define a dice set with a single dice. Swipe on up and down on the dice in the main display to step the displayed value.  You can still roll the dice by tapping on it.</p><br>


  <h3>‚öôÔ∏è App Features</h3>

  <p><strong>Does the app include sound effects during rolls?</strong><br>
  Yes, realistic dice sound effects enhance the experience during animations.</p>

  <p><strong>What is the dice roll animation playtime?</strong><br>
  The dice roll animation is two seconds long. A common period to manually roll dice.</p>

  <p><strong>Can the dice roll quicker?</strong><br>
  Yes. You can tap the top bar for a "Quick Roll" or selected this option under the hamburger menu.</p>

  <p><strong>Can I see a history or log of my previous rolls?</strong><br>
  Yes, the app keeps a log of your rolls so you can review your results anytime.</p>

  <p><strong>How do you export the dice roll history of this app?</strong><br>
  All dice roll history can be copied into the iOS clipboard to paste into other apps that accept text from the clipboard.</p>

  <p><strong>Will spreadsheets apps accept the exported roll history?</strong><br>
  The export format was specifically designed for spreadsheets.  The data copied into the clipboard from the app is in comma separated values (CSV) for imports into spreadsheet apps.</p>

  <p><strong>Are the dice rolls randomized fairly?</strong><br>
  All dice rolls are simulated where there is equal probability of each dice face showing in a given simulated dice.</p>

  <p><strong>How is the dice roll determined?</strong><br>
  The app uses Apple's built-in iOS randomization functions to generate each roll.</p>

  <p><strong>Does the app work offline without internet access?</strong><br>
  Yes, the app is fully functional offline and requires no internet connection.</p>

  <p><strong>Can the app support both vertical and horizontal screen orientations?</strong><br>
  The app is fully responsive and supports both portrait and landscape modes on all supported iOS devices.</p>

  <p><strong>Are there any easter eggs or obscure features in the app?</strong><br>
  It would not be a real Silicon Valley built app if we did not have rabbit hole features! Hint -- try taps, double-taps and long presses in different places to see what happens.</p><br>

  <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Customization & Settings</h3>

  <p><strong>How do I create, edit, save or delete dice sets?</strong><br>
  
  The dice app icon menu has two ways to make dice sets:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Choose Dice"</strong> Choose the type of games you play and the dice set used for that game.</li>
        <li><strong>"Edit Set"</strong> Brings up a dice set editor keyboard for full dice set customization.</li>
      </ul>
      This allows for casual dice games and custom dice sets.</p>

  <p><strong>Can I change the app‚Äôs theme or appearance?</strong><br>
  You can switch between three themes: Silver, Topaz and Sapphire. Tap on the theme's thumbnail image under the View tab to change themes.</p>

  <p><strong>How do I give custom name to a dice set?</strong><br>
  Yes, select "Set Label" in the app icon menu.  A view shows to enter text to give your dice set a custom name.  This name is shown below the dice set icon.</p>

  <p><strong>Are the size of the views adjustable?</strong><br>
  You can resize the dice view from the "hamburger" menu for a full view of the dice roll of a shared view with the tabs. You can also adjust the tab position by dragging one of the two-headed arrow icons between the panels.</p>

  <p><strong>Where can I disable the shake action, roll vibrations or sounds?</strong><br>
  You can toggle shake action, roll vibrations and sound effects under the User tab.</p><br>
