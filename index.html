  <p><strong>How many custom dice can I roll in a single set?</strong><br>
  The app supports from one to a hundred dice per dice set.</p>

  <p><strong>Can I roll different types of dice at once?</strong><br>
  Yes, you can roll up to four different types of dice at once. Simple compound dice sets of "1d8 + 1d4 + 1" are supported. A chaos dice set of "1d20 + 2d6 + 1d4 - 1d2" is in the Game Chooser to show how complex dice sets can become for game play.</p><br>

  <h3>🎯 Roll Display</h3>

  <p><strong>How can I view the results of my dice rolls—either as a total or by counting individual die faces?</strong><br>
  The app lets you customize how roll results are shown:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dice Total:</strong> Shows the sum of all dice rolled. Ideal for RPGs or games needing cumulative values.</li>
        <li><strong>Face Count:</strong> Displays how many times each face value appears (e.g., "3 sixes, 2 ones").</li>
        <li><strong>Dice Pool:</strong> Counts how many dice are at or beyond a set threshold (e.g., "count of 8d6 showing 4 or greater").</li>
        <li><strong>Dice Subset:</strong> Totals a defined amount highest dice of a rolled set (e.g., "add the highest three dice rolled of 4d6").</li>
      </ul>
      You can choose these types of rolls from the dice keyboard to fit your game. Custom dice sets are kept in the Dice tab Suite view.</p>

  <p><strong>How are dices set displayed?</strong><br>
  Dice set are displayed in different ways across the app. The main and dice set views uses the name of the dice game or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation">common dice notation</a>. The dice hand view shows each individual dice in the current chosen dice set.</p>
      
  <p><strong>Are there any details kept about dice sets once entered and rolled?</strong><br>
  Yes, tap on the dice set and select the "Info" menu option.  The dice count, roll average, and last roll time are displayed.</p>
      
  <p><strong>Can I use dice in this app as a score keeper or a manual counter?</strong><br>
  Yes, define a dice set with a single die. Swipe on up and down on the dice in the main display to step the displayed value.  You can still roll the dice by tapping on it.</p><br>


  <h3>⚙️ App Features</h3>

  <p><strong>Does the app include sound effects during rolls?</strong><br>
  Yes, realistic dice sound effects enhance the experience during animations.</p>

  <p><strong>What is the dice roll animation playtime?</strong><br>

  <p><strong>Can the dice roll quicker?</strong><br>
  Yes. You can double-tap the middle of the message bar (just below the link button) for a "Quick Roll" or select this option under the hamburger menu.</p>

  The export format was specifically designed for spreadsheets.  The data copied into the clipboard from the app is in comma-separated values (CSV) for imports into spreadsheet apps.</p>

  <p><strong>Are the dice rolls randomized fairly?</strong><br>
  All dice rolls are simulated where there is equal probability of each dice face showing in a given simulated die.</p>

  <p><strong>How is the dice roll determined?</strong><br>
  The app uses Apple's built-in iOS randomization functions to generate each roll. This resource is also used for security and other features.</p>

  <p><strong>Does the app work offline without internet access?</strong><br>
  This app release (v2.6) is fully functional offline and requires no internet connection.</p>

  <p><strong>What if my device has Bluetooth or WiFi turned off?</strong><br>

  The app is fully responsive and supports both portrait and landscape modes on all supported iOS devices.</p>

  <p><strong>Are there any easter eggs or obscure features in the app?</strong><br>
  It would not be a real Silicon Valley-built app if we did not have rabbit holes! Hint -- try taps, double-taps, and swipes in different places to see what happens.</p><br>

  <h3>🛠️ Customization & Settings</h3>

  <p><strong>How do I create, edit, save, or delete dice sets?</strong><br>

                    Made in Silicon Valley: The Origin of Dice Infinity
                    </div>
                    <p>Born from basement gaming sessions around a poker table in a suburb, a lifelong passion for board games and role-playing games blossomed into decades of tech innovation. This app’s development was shaped by my careers, family, and contributions to early to modern mobile systems, including the pioneering Dice Roller app for the Apple Newton, showcased at the Origins Game Fair in July 1994.</p>
                    <p>When my kids discovered tabletop RPGs, they eagerly downloaded dice apps on their phones. After sharing my insights, my son challenged me with a question: <i>“Dad, can you make a better dice app?”</i> My enthusiastic response was a resounding yes.</p>
                    <p>Two years of funded development, fueled by my experience in mobile, UX, and device design, culminated in the creation of Dice Infinity. This elegant, fast, and clutter-free digital dice companion is crafted with a gamer’s heart and an engineer’s discipline. It’s always ready to spring into action whenever you need a dice roll or have a moment for a dice game.</p>
