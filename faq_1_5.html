  <h3>üéØ Roll Display</h3>

  <p><strong>How can I view the results of my dice rolls‚Äîeither as a total or by counting individual die faces?</strong><br>
  The app lets you customize how roll results are shown:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Roll Total:</strong> Shows the sum of all dice rolled. Ideal for RPGs or games needing cumulative values.</li>
        <li><strong>Face Count:</strong> Displays how many times each face value appears (e.g., "3 sixes, 2 ones").</li>
      </ul>
      You can switch between these display modes by:
      <ul>
        <li>Opening the <strong>‚ÄúHamburger‚Äù menu</strong> in the roll view</li>
        <li>Using the <strong>‚ÄúDice roll display options‚Äù</strong> in the settings</li>
      </ul>
      Choose the mode that best fits your gameplay style!</p>
      
  <p><strong>Are there any details kept about dice sets once entered and rolled?</strong><br>
  Yes, tap on the dice set and selected the "Info" menu option.  The dice count, roll average and last roll time is displayed.</p>
      
  <p><strong>Can I use dice in this app as a score keeper or a manual counter?</strong><br>

  The export format was specifically designed for spreadsheets.  The data copied into the clipboard from the app is in comma separated values (CSV) for imports into spreadsheet apps.</p>

  <p><strong>Are the dice rolls randomized fairly?</strong><br>
  All dice rolls are simulated where there is equal probability of each dice face showing in a given simulated dice.</p>

  <p><strong>How do I create, edit, save or delete dice sets?</strong><br>
